About

ImageCurator is a Python-based GUI tool designed for efficiently curating large sets of images. Built with PySimpleGUI and leveraging advanced image processing techniques, this tool helps photographers, data scientists, and content creators to streamline their workflows.

Duplicate Detection: Finds and highlights duplicate images.
Blur Assessment: Automatically flags blurry images.
Manual Curation: Allows users to manually curate the remaining images through a user-friendly interface.
Batch Processing: Quickly process hundreds or thousands of images at once.

Additional Notes:
- Keep terminal open while curating, its the ENGINE
- Curation Tool tracks your progress and skips the pre-process if it has already been ran. Just reload folder in case you need to pick up where you left off
